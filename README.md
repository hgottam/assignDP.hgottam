# assignDP.hgottam


## Implemented Facade, Bridge, Factory, Iterator, Visitor design patterns.

* Facade design pattern: Implemented this design pattern by delegating functionalities to various classes like Login, Trading and interfaces like ProductMenu. Implemented appropriate methods as required.

* Bridge design pattern: Implemented this design pattern to display the PTBS menu options. Based on user type, Buyer and Seller menu options are displayed. Similarly based on the type of product, i.e, Meat and Produce , respective menu is shown based on user selection.

* Factory design pattern: Implemented this design pattern to instantiate classes as per need. "Person" abstract class is accessed and instantiated as buyer and seller at runtime using information present in seller.txt and buyer.txt

* Iterator design pattern: This design pattern is implemented with help of productIterator method where the all the products are easily accessed by other parts of the system.

* Visitor design pattern: Implemented this design pattern to call remind and to accept the trading between buyer and seller. For simplicity of the code, called remindVisitors methods from facade and trading classes.




#Provided high level functionality comments for all implementated methods in the source code
